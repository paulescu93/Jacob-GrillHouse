    <p style="text-align:center">We have chosen a special and unique location, close to the forest and the main tourist attraction in Transylvania (The ASTRA Museum of Traditional Folk Civilization â€“ or The Open Air Museum). </p>

    <p style="text-align:center">We started from scratch and we designed a special place with glass walls, which offers our clients a relaxing and memorable view towards the forest. In addition, we put a fireplace in the center of the restaurant which will warm up the atmosphere, especially during the cold season. During the warm season, the specious terrace will be the perfect place for our clients to enjoy our delicious dishes. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Knowing all the advantages of the Josper oven-grill, we wanted it in our own kitchen, as it offers a unique flavour and maintains the freshness and juiciness of the meat cooked at high temperatures, carefully observed by our chefs.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class= "read_all">The menu was designed to offer </span> <span class="mobile_read">... (read more)</span><span class= "none"> our clients a wide range of dishes, mainly based on grilled specialties. Thus, the veal, beef, pork, duck, New Zealand lamb, but also the fish and sea food will astound with taste and presentation. Let`s not forget about the delicious burgers with the same flavour from the Josper oven-grill. And when it comes to desserts, we have some mouth watering surprises in store for you. </span></p>

        <p style="text-align:center">You are welcome to enjoy all the advantages this place has to offer, particularly for Sibiu and we promise to always be open to any suggestions that you may have and that could help us improve this project. </p>
